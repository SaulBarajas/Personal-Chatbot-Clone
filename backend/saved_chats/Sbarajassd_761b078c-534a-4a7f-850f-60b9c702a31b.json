There are many languages to choose from, but I'll suggest a few popular ones:\n\n1. **Python**: A great language for beginners, easy to read and write, and has a vast number of libraries and resources.\n2. **JavaScript**: A versatile language used for web development, game development, and mobile app development.\n3. **HTML/CSS**: Not a programming language, but essential for building websites and web applications.\n\nWhich one of these languages interests you the most?\n\n(Note: We can always switch to a different language later if you find you prefer it.)\n\nAlso, what's your learning style?\n\n1. **Text-based tutorials**: I'll provide step-by-step instructions and code examples.\n2. **Interactive coding exercises**: We'll work on coding challenges together.\n3. **Video tutorials**: I'll provide links to video tutorials and online courses.\n\nLet me know your preferences, and we'll get started!",
