We'll learn about DNA, genes, and how traits are passed down from one generation to the next.\n3. **Evolution**: The study of how living organisms change over time. We'll explore the mechanisms of evolution, such as natural selection and speciation.\n4. **Ecology**: The study of the relationships between living organisms and their environment. We'll learn about ecosystems, populations, and the impact of human activities on the environment.\n5. **Biochemistry**: The study of the chemical processes that occur within living organisms. We'll explore the building blocks of life, such as carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids.\n\nWhich area of bio would you like to start with?\n\nType one of the following:\n\nA) Cell Biology\nB) Genetics\nC) Evolution\nD) Ecology\nE) Biochemistry\n\nLet me know, and I'll provide you with a brief introduction and some resources to get you started!",
