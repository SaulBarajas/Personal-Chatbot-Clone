Are you looking to review a particular concept, or do you want to start from the basics and work your way up?\n\nHere are some options to get you started:\n\n1. **Basic math concepts**: We can review addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, or move on to more advanced topics like fractions, decimals, and percentages.\n2. **Algebra**: We can explore equations, graphing, and functions, or dive into more advanced topics like systems of equations and quadratic equations.\n3. **Geometry**: We can learn about points, lines, angles, and shapes, or explore more advanced topics like trigonometry and 3D geometry.\n4. **Calculus**: We can introduce the basics of limits, derivatives, and integrals, or explore more advanced topics like differential equations and multivariable calculus.\n5. **Math topics of your choice**: Is there a specific area of math that interests you, such as statistics, probability, or number theory?\n\nLet me know which direction you'd like to take, and we can get started!",
